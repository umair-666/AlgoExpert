# Algorithm Visualizer




## Overview

Algorithm Visualizer is a Python project that allows you to visualize various pathfinding and graph traversal algorithms. It provides an interactive graphical interface for users to understand and observe how algorithms work on a grid.

## Features

- Visualization of popular algorithms such as Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS, Best First Search, A* Algorithm, and MST.
- Interactive grid where users can set the start and end points, draw obstacles, and run algorithms.
- Real-time visualization of the algorithm's progress.
- Clear grid functionality for easy experimentation.

## Algorithms Included

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **DFS (Depth-First Search):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backing up.
- **Best First Search:** Chooses the node that is estimated to be the closest to the goal.
- **A* Algorithm:** Combines the strengths of Dijkstra's and Best First Search algorithms, using a heuristic to guide the search.

## Interaction

- **Left Click:** Select a node or draw obstacles.
- **Right Click:** Un-select a node.
- **C:** Clear the grid.
- **D:** Run Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- **B:** Run BFS (Breadth-First Search).
- **F:** Run DFS (Depth-First Search).
- **S:** Run Best First Search.
- **A:** Run A* Algorithm.
